# Titanic_Comp
The beginning of my ML/AI journey and my very first ML fully built model.
The titanic, a famous ship that sunk in 1912, given the dataset containing each passenger information (which is in the train.csv file) could be called the training set.
Built and trained the model using ANN(Artificial Neural Network) on the training set to predict whether each passenger in the test set (test.csv) survived or not
The code for the model I built is in the Titanic_Code.ipynb file
And the file with the ID of the passengers of the test set and their survival status is in the Titanic_Submission.csv file.
I got a 78% accuracy score and will conntinuously try to improve that score in future projects.
Thank you.
